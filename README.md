RFID-Based Access Control System An Arduino Uno–based smart lock system using the MFRC522 RFID reader and a 16×2 I2C LCD. It scans RFID tags, compares them to a list of authorized UIDs, and displays “Access Granted” or “Access Denied” in real-time. Ideal for student labs, DIY access control, or IoT workshops.
