# Gas_And_oil
RFID-Based Access Control System An Arduino Uno–based smart lock system using the MFRC522 RFID reader and a 16×2 I2C LCD. It scans RFID tags, compares them to a list of authorized UIDs, and displays “Access Granted” or “Access Denied” in real-time. Ideal for student labs, DIY access control, or IoT workshops.

## 📈 Features

- Real-time gas leak detection  
- Measures gas concentration and gas flow (flux rate)  
- Buzzer alarm & alert system (SMS/email)  
- Dashboard displaying:
  - Gas concentration in PPM  
  - Flow rate in L/min  
  - Status (Normal / Leak Detected)  
- Remote control of valve through dashboard  
- Scalable for industrial zones and households  
- Supports 5G for low-latency communication

---

## 🛠️ Installation

### 🔌 Hardware Setup
1. Connect gas sensor to ESP32 analog pin  
2. Connect flux rate sensor to digital/analog pin  
3. Add buzzer and relay module for alarms  
4. Connect ESP32 to 5V power  

### 🧪 Software Setup
1. Flash the ESP32 using Arduino IDE with required libraries  
2. Set WiFi credentials and MQTT broker details  
3. Use Node-RED or ThingsBoard to visualize data

## 🧪 Testing & Results

- Simulated gas leak using lighter near sensor → Alert triggered in <2 sec  
- Dashboard updated with spike in gas PPM and flux drop  
- Remote relay cutoff tested successfully

---

## 🛡️ Safety and Compliance

- Components enclosed in flame-retardant housing  
- System can trigger alarms + cut-off valves  
- Supports integration with fire alarm systems

---

## 🌍 Future Scope

- Integration with AI for pattern recognition and predictive maintenance  
- Edge AI for offline detection  
- Solar-powered version for remote areas  
- Integration with industrial SCADA systems
